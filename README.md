# Canvas Experiments

This repository contains demos for a talk on the HTML `<canvas>` element that I will give on
28th May 2014 for the ViennaJS meetup group.

## Download and Use

This is a very simple repo. There is no build system required. Just download the files and open `index.html` in a browser.

Edit the examples in the `js/examples/` folder and then execute them by selecting them from the dropdown.
